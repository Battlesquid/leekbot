# leekbot

A bot to keep selected channels clean of messages (attachment only channels). This is something not implemented in discord so this bot handles it. The prefix is `;` (semicolon).

## Usage

**;readonlyon `[channels]`**
Takes one or more channels as parameters and disables messages in them. Please note that channels must be mentionable (starts with "#" and is highlighted on hover) and cannot be just plain text!

**;readonlyoff `[channels]`**
Enables messages in the selected channels.
